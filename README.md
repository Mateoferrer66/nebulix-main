```

### 2. Configure your Static CMS Backend

Navigate to `src/pages/admin.astro` and provide your Git repository details. You can find a list of all supported Git backends at:
<https://www.staticcms.org/docs/backends-overview>


**_Gitlab Example:_**

```javascript

const config = {
	locale: lang,
	site_url: url,
	logo_url: 'https://nebulix.unfolding.io/nebulix-logo.svg',
	local_backend: true,
	backend: {
		name: 'gitlab',
		repo: '/<your-gitlab-repo>',
		auth_type: 'pkce', // Required for pkce
		app_id: 'xxxx', // Application ID from your GitLab settings
		commit_messages: {
			create: 'Create {{collection}} "{{slug}}"',
			update: 'Update {{collection}} "{{slug}}"',
			delete: 'Delete {{collection}} "{{slug}}"',
			uploadMedia: 'Upload "{{path}}"',
			deleteMedia: 'Delete "{{path}}"'
		}
	},
	search: 'true',
    ....
}

```

### 3. Add your site to the astro config

```javascript

export default defineConfig({
	site: 'https://your-website.com',
    ....

```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

### üõ†Ô∏è 5. Start Development server

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

If you wish to engage the local backend:

```bash
$ npm run cms-proxy-server
```

Now you can open Static CMS on http://localhost:4321/admin/


## ‚ùå Removing Collections
If your cosmic journey excludes a blog, portfolio, shop, or restaurant menu, simply remove the corresponding documents from the `src/content`. Additionally, erase the page templates from `src/pages` .
